## Hi there üëã

<a href="https://amzn.to/3UjPrsK"><img src="https://effectivetypescript.com/images/cover-2e.jpg" alt="Effective TypeScript 2nd Edition Cover" style="float: left" height="250"></a>

I'm Dan, author of [_Effective TypeScript: 83 Specific Ways to Improve your TypeScript_][amzn]. The second edition came out in May 2024 and I'm [very excited about it!][blog].

[_Effective_-style books][effective] are aimed at developers who already know the nuts and bolts of a programming language, but want to learn how to use it more effectively. Rather than explaining the three ways to do X, an Effective book will tell you which one to use in which situation, and which to avoid entirely. By learning about usage, as well as the odd corners of TypeScript, you'll advance from a beginner or intermediate developer to a seasoned expert.

I also write about TypeScript online at [effectivetypescript.com](https://effectivetypescript.com/), where you can find [sample items] from the book.

I have many, many open source repos on GitHub, but here are some of the most popular by ‚≠êÔ∏ès:

- [source-map-explorer]: Answers the question "why is my JavaScript bundle so big?" using an interactive [treemap] visualization.
- [dygraphs]: Venerable JavaScript charting library. Aims to get you from data to interactive chart quickly, then give you lots of options for customization.
- [effective-typescript]: Code samples, Table of Contents and item summaries for [_Effective TypeScript_][amzn] (O'Reilly 2024).
- [oldnyc]: Source code for the [OldNYC](https://www.oldnyc.org/) geocoding pipeline, OCR and web site, [launched] in 2015.
- [webdiff]: Two-column web-based difftool with syntax highlighting and support for image diffs. Instead of `git diff`, run `git webdiff`.
- [localturk]: Perform repetitive manual tasks on your own computer using the same API as Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Great for generating some data or prototyping a Mechanical Turk UI.
- [RangeHTTPServer]: Python's built-in `http.server` does not support range requests. This extends it to fix that.
- [literate-ts]: Type check code samples in books and blogs. Used to verify [_Effective TypeScript_][amzn]. Read more [here].
- [crosswalk]: Library for adding TypeScript types to both your Express server's REST API and the client code that uses it.
- [pg-to-ts]: Generate TypeScript types for your Postgres schema. See [TypeScript and SQL: Six Ways to Bridge the Divide
][sql].
- [crudely-typed]: Simple "everyday CRUD" Postgres queries with perfect TypeScript types.
